[Original workshop description](https://cz.pycon.org/2019/programme/workshops/7/#main)

It is well possible to use Python as powerful graphical calculator and replace specialized
software as is e.g. MATLAB. This workshop provides introduction how to achieve this using
established Python packages NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib. Numpy provides fast array data
types and related operations with them, advanced scientific functions are available through
scipy and rich visualization possibilities are offered by matplotlib. Workshop will cover
installation, examples of basic functionality of numpy and scipy, pointers to documentation
of both packages, few more advanced use cases combining computation and visualization and
several real-world examples from my professional experience where these tools were useful.

## Requirements

It is possible to attend and only watch but I'd recommend to have machine with Python 3,
numpy, scipy and matplotlib already installed. Windows and Mac users can achieve this
by installing
[Python distribution Anaconda with all required packages already present](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
Linux users can follow [these instructions](https://www.scipy.org/install.html).
Anyway, there will be short section of workshop dedicated to installation for those
who didn't have time for installation before.
